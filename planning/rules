The goal of this game is to reduce the enemy's life-energy to 0. There are
monster, spell, trigger, and equipment cards.

Monster Cards:

Fights opponent monster cards or deals damage in some form, such as to
life-energy, to another monster, etc.

Monster cards have traits that can affect many things such as damage taken.Â For
example, if a monster is human and a spell the opponent is using affects humans
more then it will do more damage or have more effect relative to the amount of
human that card is.

For combat they use A/DA/DD.  A monster is in attack mode when they attack. The
attacks can be seen as spells that are used under attack conditions.  The
monster's attack determines whether or not they make it through the enemy's
defense. There is a comparison between the enemy's defense in their current
mode (DA or DD) and the attacker's attack. If the attacker wins the opponent
loses their monster.

Monsters also have an HP mechanic. This is a separate reserve of points that
can be lowered by status conditions or spells.  The monster can also die when
they lose all of their HP.

There is also a speed trait.  This resolves ties, determining which action
happened first.

Monsters can have ailments that affect their stats.

number of turns Burn - Lowers the monster's attack/defense by X amount until
cured Dizzy - Lower's the monster's ability to defend for X amount of turns,
roll a die and if it is not 5,6 then the monster successfully does the intended
