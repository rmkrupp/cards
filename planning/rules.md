# Rules

The goal of the game is to reduce all of your opponent's life-energy to 0.

## Cards


### Character Cards

These cards fight opponent character cards or deal damage in some form, such as to life-energy, another character, etc.

Character cards have traits that may affect many things, such as damage taken.  For example, if a character is human and a spell the opponent is using affects humans more, then it will do more damage or have more effect relative to the amount of human that card is.

For combat they use A/AD/DD.  A character is in attack mode when they attack.  The character's attack determines whether or not they make it through the enemy's defense.  There is a comparison between the enemy's defense in their current mode (DA or DD) and the attacker's attack.  If the attacker wins, the opponent loses their character.

Scenarios:

1. Card A (A/AD/DD = 2/1/1) attacks Card B (1/1/1) and Card B is in attack mode: Card B is destroyed because Card A's attack (2) is larger than Card B's attack defense (1)

2. A (2/1/1) attacks B (1/2/1) in attack mode.  A is destroyed because defender's AD is greater than or equal to attacker's attack.

3. A (2/1/1) attacks B (1/1/3) in defense mode.  Card A is destroyed. (ties go to the defender)

4. A (2/1/1) attacks B (1/1/3) in defense mode.  Card A is destroyed.

5. A (2/1/1) attacks B (1/1/3) in attack mode.  Card B is destroyed.

Character cards can have abilities that are invoked like spell cards.

Characters also have an HP mechannic.  This is a separate reserve of points that can be lowered by status conditions or spells.  The character is destroyed if they lose all of their HP.

Cards with non-zero attack have a RANGE attribute that determines how many zones they can attack over.  Cards with range 0 must be in the front zone to attack, with range one they can be in the front zone or the zone behind that and attack.

### Equipment Cards

These cards alter one or more traits of the character it is attached to until that card is destroyed.  Killing the character card it is attached to destroys the equipment card.

Equipment can be attached and detached from any character in your field as many times as you like.

### Spell Cards

These are single use cards that alter some aspect of the game when played.  Spell cards have durations anywhere from instant to permanent.

### Trigger Cards

These cards are single use and trigger when a condition the player has entered is met. This condition can be changed on the player's turn. Trigger cards, when triggered, are essentially spell cards.

### Face

Character cards can be played face down in attack or defense mode or face up in attack or defense mode.  They cannot attack while face down, and if they are attacked they become face up.

Spell cards cannot be played face down.

Trigger cards must be played face down unless they are to be immediately triggered.  When a trigger card is triggered, it becomes face up.

Equipment cards must be placed face up, even if they are equipped to a face down character.

Cards can be flipped from down to up during the move phase of your turn, but cards cannot be flipped from up to down without a special ability.

### Zones

For each player:

All trigger, spell, and unattached equipment cards go in a special zone.

All characters go in a single zone, numbered from the zone closest to the player to the zone farthest. There can be as many zones as there are characters.

## Gameplay

### Turn Actions

On your turn...

 1. You must draw 1 card.
 2. You can do as many of these as you want in any order (these actions apply only to cards in your field)
    1. activate any spells, triggers, or abilities
    2. play any number of cards
        1. if a character card is played it can go into any character zone
        2. Otherwise, it goes into the special zone

    3. change any cards from attack mode to defense mode
    4. change any cards from defense mode to attack mode
    5. flip any face-down cards face-up (if they are spells or triggers this activates them)
    6. move cards from one zone to another (this can create or destroy zones as needed)
    7. destroy any card, sending it to a grave
    8. attach an equipment to a card
    9. detach an equipment from a card

3. You can attack with up to one card
4. You can activate any spells, triggers, or abilities in play
5. If there is a game limit on the number of cards in your hand, you must discard cards until the limit is met
6. Finally, you must end your turn.

At any point after your turn begins (including before you have drawn a card) until the end of your turn, you can change the conditions under which a trigger activates.


### Energy

Some cards provide play-energy whenever they are in play face up.

Some cards require there to be a minimum play-energy in play before they can be played.

Play-energy combines from all sources and is equal for all players.

If play-energy decreases and a card no longer has its minimum play-energy, it cannot use any abilities (the effect of ongoing spells stop, triggers cannot be triggered, and other activated abilities cannot be used) but a character card can still attack, defend, move, turn face up, or switch modes.

### Attacking

If a card (which much in attack mode) attacks and:

+  The enemy has no character cards, the attack must target the enemy's
life-energy

+ The enemy has character cards but they are all in attack mode, the
attack can target any character (dependent on attacker's A and defender's DA);
or, it can target the enemy's life energy

+ the enemy has defender cards, the attack must target one of the the
enemy's defender cards

Characters are placed into numbered zones. Zones may not be empty, but
zones can be created "between" or "behind" other zones, moving some number of
zones forward.

Defenders in a zone protect all zones behind them from attack until there
are no more defenders in that zone. The last zone (the zone closest to the
player) protects the player's life-energy.


### Status Ailments

Character cards can get ailments that affect their stats/abilities

Poison - Lowers the character's HP by X amount of points for a random number of turns

Burn - Lowers the character's attack/defense by X amount until the burn is healed

Dizzy - Lower's the character's ability to defend for X amount of turns.  Roll a die and if it is not 6, then the character successfully performs their action.

### Grave(s)

Your grave is a stack of cards where your destroyed cards go.  Newly discarded cards go on top.

Game settings determine whether the grave and discard are the same.
